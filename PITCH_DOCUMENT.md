## 🌊 Why This Matters for Cornwall

### Preserving Living Memory
Cornwall has a unique cultural identity—from its Celtic heritage to mining traditions, fishing communities, and distinct local customs. Much of this knowledge exists only in the memories of older generations. **Every year, irreplaceable stories are lost.**

### Bridging Generations
Young Cornish people often move away and lose connection to their heritage. This platform creates a permanent, searchable archive that future generations can explore—hearing their grandparents' voices and reading their stories forever.

### Community Building
The platform encourages interaction through comments, allowing families to reconnect over shared memories and strangers to discover they share common heritage.

### Digital Tourism & Education
A rich archive of authentic Cornish stories becomes a resource for:
- Schools teaching local history
- Researchers studying Cornish culture
- Tourists wanting deeper connection to places they visit
- The Cornish diaspora worldwide
